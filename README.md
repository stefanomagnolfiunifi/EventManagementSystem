# Event Management System
This is an Event Management System developed using the Python framework 'Django'. Here are explained functionalities and how to use the web app.
### Functionalities
The web app allow users to attend events. If the user is an organizer he can create and manage his own events.
## How to use
### Login
You have to be logged to use the app. If you don't have an account you can create one. You must be at least 14 year old to sign up.
### Use the app
Once you logged, you can basically do three things:
*View your profile.
*View all events: you can view and manage upcoming events, the ones you signed up for and, if you are an organizer, the ones you organized.
*Create new event (only if you are an organizer).
*Logout.
### Pre-populated database
In the pre-populated database there are Attendees (Alice_Attendee, Sofia_Attendee, Vincenzo_Attendee, Stefano_Attendee, Lorenzo_Attendee) and Organizers (Roberta_Organizer, Paolo_Organizer). Passwords are 'partecipante' for all the Attendees and 'responsabile' for both the Organizers. 
All the users (both Attendees and Organizers) are registered for some events.
Finally, the superuser's username and password is admin.
